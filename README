# fty-sensor-env

Component sending temperature and humidity data from RackController's sensors
connected to "TH" ports

Attention: file src/Makemodule.am was modified in order to compile it for CentOS
line should look like this: src_agent_th_CPPFLAGS = ${AM_CPPFLAGS} -D__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS (added definition)
(can modify via src/Makemodule-local/am instead)
